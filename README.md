Beginner Python Projects Repository:

Welcome to my repository of beginner-level Python projects! This collection showcases my proficiency in Python fundamentals and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The projects in this repository are designed to be approachable for those just starting their Python journey, while still providing opportunities to practice essential programming skills.

Project List:

Hangman: A classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. Test your word-guessing skills and have fun with this interactive console-based game.

Mail Merge: A simple script that automates the process of generating personalized letters or emails by merging data from a CSV file with a template file.

Coffee Machine Prototype: A simulation of a coffee machine that takes orders and manages resources like water, milk, coffee beans, and money.

Quiz Game: A command-line quiz application that tests your knowledge on various topics. Challenge yourself or play with friends!

Blackjack: A implementation of the popular casino game Blackjack, where players try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

Higher Lower Game: A fun guessing game where you have to determine which of two options (e.g., celebrities, countries) has a higher value based on a specific metric.

Painting: A project related to digital painting or image manipulation.
